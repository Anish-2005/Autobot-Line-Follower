# 🚗 Autobot Line Follower 🤖

Welcome to the **Autobot Line Follower** project! This exciting robotics project is all about building a smart robot that autonomously follows a designated path using line-tracking sensors. Let's get started and dive into the details of creating and programming your very own line-following robot! 🛠️✨

## 📜 Project Overview

The **Autobot Line Follower** is a robot that can detect and follow a line on the ground. It's designed to stay on track, using sensors to detect black lines on a white surface (or vice versa), adjusting its direction automatically. Perfect for beginners in robotics and a great way to explore basic AI concepts. 💡

## 🧰 Components Required

Here are the essentials you’ll need to build your Autobot:

- **Chassis Kit** 🛠️ - The robot’s body frame.
- **Microcontroller** (like Arduino or ESP32) 🧠 - The brain of the Autobot.
- **Line Tracking Sensors** 👀 - To detect lines and keep the robot on track.
- **Motors and Wheels** 🚗 - To give it mobility.
- **Motor Driver Module** 🕹️ - Controls motor speed and direction.
- **Battery Pack** 🔋 - Power source to keep it running.
- **Jumper Wires** 🌈 - To connect components.

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

Follow these steps to assemble and program your Autobot!

### Step 1: Assemble the Robot Chassis 🛠️

1. Attach the motors and wheels to the chassis.
2. Fix the battery pack securely.
3. Mount the line tracking sensors at the front of the chassis.

### Step 2: Connect the Circuit 🔌

- Connect the motors to the **motor driver module**.
- Connect the motor driver to the **microcontroller**.
- Attach the **line tracking sensors** to the microcontroller.
  
*(Refer to the circuit diagram above for detailed wiring instructions!)*

### Step 3: Upload the Code 💻

1. Install the **Arduino IDE** if you're using an Arduino microcontroller.
2. Connect the microcontroller to your computer via USB.
3. Download or write the code (see below) and upload it to the board.

## 💻 Code

Here’s some sample code to get your Autobot moving. You can tweak it based on your sensor and motor configuration.

```cpp
#define leftMotor 3
#define rightMotor 5
#define leftSensor A0
#define rightSensor A1

void setup() {
  pinMode(leftMotor, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(rightMotor, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(leftSensor, INPUT);
  pinMode(rightSensor, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
  int leftReading = analogRead(leftSensor);
  int rightReading = analogRead(rightSensor);

  if (leftReading > threshold) {
    // Adjust to the right
    digitalWrite(leftMotor, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(rightMotor, LOW);
  } else if (rightReading > threshold) {
    // Adjust to the left
    digitalWrite(leftMotor, LOW);
    digitalWrite(rightMotor, HIGH);
  } else {
    // Move forward
    digitalWrite(leftMotor, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(rightMotor, HIGH);
  }
}
