## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Assemble the Chassis 🛠️

1. Mount the motors and wheels onto the chassis.
2. Attach the battery pack securely to the frame.
3. Position the line tracking sensors at the front of the chassis for optimal line detection.

### Step 2: Wire the Circuit 🔌

- Connect the motors to the motor driver module.
- Connect the motor driver to the microcontroller.
- Attach the line tracking sensors to the microcontroller.

*(Refer to the circuit diagram above for wiring details!)*

### Step 3: Upload the Code 💻

1. Install the **Arduino IDE** if you're using an Arduino microcontroller.
2. Connect your microcontroller to the computer.
3. Download or write the code provided below and upload it to the microcontroller.

## 💻 Sample Code

This sample code will get your Autobot up and running. You can customize the `threshold` value based on your specific sensors and testing.

```cpp
#define leftMotor 3
#define rightMotor 5
#define leftSensor A0
#define rightSensor A1
int threshold = 500; // Adjust based on your sensor

void setup() {
  pinMode(leftMotor, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(rightMotor, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(leftSensor, INPUT);
  pinMode(rightSensor, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
  int leftReading = analogRead(leftSensor);
  int rightReading = analogRead(rightSensor);

  if (leftReading > threshold) {
    // Adjust to the right
    digitalWrite(leftMotor, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(rightMotor, LOW);
  } else if (rightReading > threshold) {
    // Adjust to the left
    digitalWrite(leftMotor, LOW);
    digitalWrite(rightMotor, HIGH);
  } else {
    // Move forward
    digitalWrite(leftMotor, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(rightMotor, HIGH);
  }
}
